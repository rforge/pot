The POT package aims to provide operational tools to analyze
<acronym title="Peaks Over Threshold">POT.</acronym>  This package
relies on the <acronym title="Extreme Value Theory">EVT</acronym> to
model the tail of any continuous distribution.  Tail modelling, in
particular POT modelling, is of great importance for many financial
and environmental applications.
<p>
  The POT package was first committed to
  the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">
    <acronym title="Comprehensive R Archive Network">
      CRAN </acronym> </a> in April 2005 and is still in active
  development.The main motivation was to provide practical tools for
  probabilistic modelling of high flood flows.  However, the strength
  of the EVT is that results do not depend on the process to be
  modelled.  Thus, one can use the POT package to analyze
  precipitations, floods, financial times series, earthquakes and so
  on...
