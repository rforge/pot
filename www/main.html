POT project aims to provide functional tools to model peaks over (high
enough) threshold. These tools are related to the so-called Extreme
Value Theory (EVT). In the last decades, the EVT has becomming an
increasing popular statistical domain. Typical applications belongs to
environmental, insurance and financial analysis. However, still works
remain to be done; for instance, spatial modeling for extreme, trend
analysis, multivariate extremes.</small></big><br></div><big><small><br>If you are interested in contributing to the POT project, please do not hesitate to join it!<br></small></big></body></html>
